# Overview #

The - **0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O** seeks to introduce various **sorting algorithms**, their pros, cons and use-cases, as well as the **Big Oh Notation**. Other objectives are:
1. How to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
2. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
3. What a stable sorting and unstable algorithm is.
